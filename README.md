# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## Dataset
Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding
- Train-test split
- Model building using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (Final Model)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 77.4%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 71.6%
- Random Forest Accuracy: 73.5%

Logistic Regression performed the best and was selected as the final model.

## Key Insights
- Females had higher survival chances.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Fare and age also influenced survival.

## How to Run
Open Titanic.ipynb and run all cells in order.
